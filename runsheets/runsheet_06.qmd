## Polynomial regression  {#sec-fry02}

Individually, or as a group, revisit @sec-fry alongside the suggested solution given in @sec-solutions. Discuss and summarise each fitted model and modelling choice made. Chose and justify your choice of preferred/"best" model?

## Q&A and Task 04 {#sec-peershare06}

[**Task 04**](https://canvas.auckland.ac.nz/courses/120054/assignments/436860)

> Git is a version control system that manages the evolution of a set of files, called a repository (repo), in a structured way (*think of Word's Track Changes*). 

> GitHub is a hosting service that provides a hgme for your git-based projects on the internet (*think of Dropbox*).

The template repo you've been invited to in [Task 04](https://canvas.auckland.ac.nz/courses/120054/assignments/436860) is set up as a `RStudio` Project. It contains the basics for you to get started on the analysis for your assessed project! For this [Task 04](https://canvas.auckland.ac.nz/courses/120054/assignments/436860) all I'd like you to do is 1) connect to the repo assignment you've been invited to, 2) make a change locally in the repo, 3) then commit and push this change to the remote repo. **We'll do this in class if you've not yet already.**
