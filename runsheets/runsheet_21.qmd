## <i class="fa fa-question-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> <i class="fa fa-users" aria-hidden="true"></i> <i class="fa fa-pencil-square" aria-hidden="true"></i> GitHub Repo Tour

I will be coming around each group to discuss the blocks below, as you are waiting...

Take it in turn to take your peers on a tour of your  [GitHub code repository](https://canvas.auckland.ac.nz/courses/120054/assignments/436872) as-it stands! How do you think it scores in terms of the rubric? Any suggestions to improve your peers' repo?

  "Lacks clear intro, body, or conclusion. Structure is confusing and ineffective.",
  "Many grammar issues, unclear and hard to follow writing. Lacks coherence.",
  "Poor or incorrect explanation of methods. Little understanding shown.",
  "Fails to analyze or interpret data effectively. No meaningful conclusions.",
  "No insights beyond expected analysis. Lacks creativity or depth."

### What I am not expecting

 + A fully fledged paper
 
    + This exercise is more one in reviewing!
    
 + A regurgitation of the publication
 
    + This exercise if for you to showcase your understanding of a research topic of your choice
    
 + Too much beyond the content of the course
 
    + You should, though, feel free to read up on any methods you find that are new and draw parallels to content we’ve covered.
    

### What I am expecting


 + A coherent and insightful essay
 
    + Use this to showcase your understanding
    + Use this to demonstrate your critical thinking
    + What to think of
    
         + Is the writing appropriate for the target audience? 
         + Does your work skillfully interpret the results?
         + Are your tables/figures clear, effective, and informative?
         + Do you make the appropriate links to the article you are reviewing/critiquing/rese

### What I am expecting

  + A fully reproducible code repository

       + Imagine that someone with no knowledge of this stumbles across your repo and wishes to find out about what it contains and wants to reproduce your work
