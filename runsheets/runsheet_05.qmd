[Here is a handout](https://canvas.auckland.ac.nz/courses/120054/files/14903576?module_item_id=2564916) with nothing but data summaries and linear model summary output given. On the whiteboards sketch the model fit (including uncertainty), for each case.

## Linear model diagnostics

### Residual plots (*a recap*) {#sec-qq}

<center><img src="https://github.com/statbiscuit/swots/blob/master/figs_n_gifs/lm.gif?raw=true" alt="GIF of linear model residuals"></center>

Otherwise known as *least squares* regression, by default `lm()` seeks to minimize the squared Euclidean distance between the observations and the fitted line.

Individually, or in a group, use `lm()` to model the data from @fries (plotted above), these can be read into your `R` session as follows.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
fries <- readr::read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STATS-UOA/databunker/master/data/fries.csv")
```

 1. Choose and then plot your best-fitting model. How did you decide on your "best" model?
 2. The function `dredge` is from the `R` package `MuMIn`; it is very useful for model selection. `dredge()` generates a model selection table of models with combinations of fixed effect terms in the given global (full) model. By default `dredge()` uses AICc as its model comparison metric. Supplying your "best" model from 1) write out the top two selected models as chosen by dredge (including the estimated coefficients). From all the considered models which would you select? Justify your answer. Note, you should use residual plots in your justification. (p.s. you may need to set  `na.action = na.fail` in your `lm()` call for `dregde()` to work)

## Communicating statistics {#sec-comm}

In our very first lecture (@sec-intro) we discussed the [assessment structure of BIOSCI 738](https://biosci738.github.io/BIOSCI738/key-information.html#assessment-summary) and we saw that communication-focused activities/assessment made up 50% of the total assessments:

## Data discussion {#sec-project}

:::{.callout-warning icon=false}
## <i class="fa fa-question-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> <i class="fa fa-users" aria-hidden="true"></i> <i class="fa fa-pencil-square" aria-hidden="true"></i> Consultant and Client

In turn, take on the following roles: **Consultant** and **Client**.

As the **Client** answer the following questions about your chosen paper for your [written report](https://canvas.auckland.ac.nz/courses/120054/assignments/436873) (*or if you've not decided yet then use the heather data that you plotted in your diagnostic task (@sec-peershare01)*).

 + What are the primary objectives of the/your project/analysis?
 + What specific questions or problems are you trying to address with your analysis?
 + What variables are included in your dataset?
 + Are there any known issues with the data/variables?

As the **Consultant**, your role is to question the **Client** and ask for specific details/clarifications along the way. After the Q&A session, you should be able to surmise your **Client's** project in your own words.

## Interactive Oral assessments (IOAs) {#sec-ioa}

Don't worry too much if you've not completely delved into/chosen your [project data](https://canvas.auckland.ac.nz/courses/120054/assignments/436873). However, the activity from above (@sec-project) will basically be mirrored in your [Interactive 01 assessment](https://canvas.auckland.ac.nz/courses/120054/assignments/436870).

### What is an IOA

> IOAs are novel, low-stakes authentic assessments, designed to promote academic integrity and prepare students for the workplace. Communication as a key skill in the UoA's graduate profile and is integral for students' skill development and employability. An IOA is authentic because it is based on a real-world scenario and promotes student engagement and facilitates higher-order thinking. It also preserves academic integrity through its unscripted conversation prompts based on student responses. --- @ioa

 1. Read through and summarise [this assessment activity](https://canvas.auckland.ac.nz/courses/120054/assignments/436870),
 2. (Re)watch the example IOAs from above and discuss as a group how you would grade Rishika according to the given rubric, and
 3. Discuss/write out what amendments would you like to see to the proposed rubric (see assignment) so that, as you see it, it better reflects your input (I will update the rubric accordingly if I deem the suggestions a better reflection of effort!)
