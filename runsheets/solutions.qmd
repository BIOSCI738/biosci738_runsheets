## Suggested `R` code solutions

This section will be update with my suggested solutions to the class wide activities after their conclusion. I **strongly** recommend that you review these outside of class if only to familiarise yourself with a different approach.

## Suggested solution to @sec-gorilla

```{r, eval = FALSE}
require(tidyverse)
## read in data
data <- readr::read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STATS-UOA/databunker/master/data/BMI.csv")
data
## Mean BMI
data %>%
    summarise(mean(bmi)) %>%
    round()
## Max BMI males
data %>%
    filter(gender == "male") %>%
    filter(bmi == max(bmi))
## t-test BMI males vs females
t.test(bmi ~ gender, data = data)
## t-test steps males vs females
t.test(steps ~ gender, data = data) 

## plotting. ALWAYS PLOT YOUR DATA!
ggplot(data, aes(x = steps, y = bmi, col = gender)) +
    geom_point()
```
