### Case study 01

Revisiting @sec-multi and @sec-multi02 may be useful here.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(predictmeans) ## install using install.packages("predictmeans")
rats <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STATS-UOA/databunker/master/data/crd_rats_data.csv")
rats <- rats %>%
  mutate(Surgery = as.factor(Surgery))
## CRD analysis
rats_lm <- lm(logAUC ~ Surgery, data = rats)
## Prompt 1:  interpret the output from summary(rats_lm)$coef
summary(rats_lm)$coef
## Prompt 2: interpret the output from anova(rats_lm)
anova(rats_lm)
## Prompt 3, 4, and 5
## what do the specified arguments to predictmeans() do? (HINT: use R help)
## what are the elements returned in the object pm?
## specify plot = TRUE in the predictmeans() call, how would you interpret the resulting plot?
pm <- predictmeans::predictmeans(rats_lm , modelterm = "Surgery", 
                                     pairwise = TRUE, plot = FALSE)
pm ## a lot of output
## Prompt 6: what are the three lines of code doing after this prompt?
url <- "https://gist.github.com/cmjt/72f3941533a6bdad0701928cc2924b90"
devtools::source_gist(url, quiet = TRUE) ## install using install.packages("devtools")
comparisons(pm)
## Prompt 7: explain each element of the calculations going into creating the object HSD
HSD <- (qtukey(p = 1 - 0.05, nmeans = 3, df = 12 - 3)/sqrt(2))*sqrt(2 * anova(rats_lm)[2,3] / 4)
TukeyHSD(aov(logAUC ~ Surgery, data = rats))
## Prompt 8: Use all the relevant pieces of the script (hint what is the alpha.adj object below?) to calculate the pairwise comparison between Surgery C and S, using Fisher’s, Bonferonni’s, and Tukey’s correction methods respectively. You should state the difference, and 95% CI in each case. What do you notice about these three intervals? How are they similar/dissimilar? Show your workings.
alpha.adj <- 0.05/choose(3,2)
## Prompt 9: Produce a plot that compares the three methods above
```


### Case study 02

Revisiting @sec-mods may be useful here.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
data <- readr::read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STATS-UOA/databunker/master/data/factorial_expt.csv")
## below we change the treatments to factors, simply because later on if we
## use predictmeans it will have a tantrum if this isn't the case
data <- data %>%
    mutate(Disease = as.factor(Disease)) %>%
    mutate(Organ = as.factor(Organ))
## Prompt 1: what model has been fitted here and what does the output from the anova() call indicate?
model <- lm(logAUC ~ Disease*Organ, data = data)
anova(model)
## Prompt 2: what model has been fitted here and what does the output from the anova() call indicate?
model_2 <- lm(logAUC ~ Organ*Disease, data = data)
anova(model_2)
#####################################
##****making the data unbalanced***
data_sub <- data[-c(1:3, 10),]
#####################################
## Prompt 3: what model has been fitted here and what does the output from the anova() call indicate?
mod <- lm(logAUC ~ Disease*Organ, data = data_sub)
anova(mod)
## Prompt 4: what model has been fitted here and what does the output from the anova() call indicate?
mod_2 <- lm(logAUC ~ Organ*Disease, data = data_sub)
anova(mod_2)
## Prompt 5: run and interpret the output from the following code, what do you conclude?
pm <- predictmeans::predictmeans(model = mod ,modelterm = "Disease:Organ", 
                                 pairwise = TRUE)
```


### Case study 03

Revisiting @sec-randomeff and @sec-ss may be useful here as well as [this section of the course guide](https://biosci738.github.io/BIOSCI738/linear-mixed-effect-models-lmms.html).

```{r, eval = FALSE}
require(tidyverse)
require(lme4)
require(predictmeans)
rcbd <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STATS-UOA/databunker/master/data/rcbd.csv")
## turn appropriate variables into factors
rcbd <- rcbd %>%
  mutate(Run = as.factor(Run)) %>%
  mutate(Surgery = as.factor(Surgery))
## run as a fixed effect
lm(logAUC8 ~ Run + Surgery, data = rcbd) |> summary()
## run as a random effect, what's the difference?
lmm <- lme4::lmer(logAUC8 ~ Surgery + (1|Run), data = rcbd) 
summary(lmm)
## diagnostics estimated variance partitioning and more...
## these are really useful utility functions!
predictmeans::residplot(lmm)
predictmeans::R2_glmm(lmm)
predictmeans::se_ranef(lmm)
predictmeans::varcomp(lmm)
predictmeans::permmodels(lmm) ## remember permutation tests, what are we using them for here? Compare to a summary() output

```

### Case study 04

Now, we're going to get a little more advanced and model some data from @monkey (data retrieved from @monkeydata). To do so we're following along (somewhat) with the steps summarised in @danblog. Revisiting @sec-randomeff may, again, be useful here.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
## wrangle as per Dan's blog
require(tidyverse)
data <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STATS-UOA/databunker/master/data/monkey.csv")
data %>%
    ggplot(., aes(x = age, y = Activity)) +
    geom_point() 
## Number of active intervals in the first two minutes (0-8)
activity_2mins <- data |>
  filter(obs<9) |> group_by(subj_id, Day) |>
  summarize(total=sum(Activity), 
            active_bins = sum(Activity > 0), 
            age = min(age)) |>
  rename(monkey = subj_id, day = Day) |>
ungroup()
length(table(activity_2mins$monkey))
activity_2mins %>%
    ggplot(., aes(x = age, y = total, col = as.factor(monkey))) +
    facet_wrap(~day) +
    geom_point() + theme(legend.position = "none")
## Linear model...
fit_lm <- lm(active_bins ~ age*factor(day) + factor(monkey), data = activity_2mins)
fit_lm |>
summary()
## ignore monkeys
fit_lm_pool <- lm(active_bins ~ age*factor(day), data = activity_2mins)
fit_lm_pool |>
summary()
fit_lm_pool |> gglm::gglm() ## and what do we think here?
## plot
plot(fit_lm_pool$fitted, fit_lm_pool$residuals)
## why scale?
age_centre <- mean(activity_2mins$age)
age_scale <- diff(range(activity_2mins$age))/2
active_bins_centre <- 4

activity_2mins_scaled <- activity_2mins |>
  mutate(monkey = factor(monkey),
         day = factor(day),
         age_centred = (age - age_centre)/age_scale,
         active_bins_scaled = (active_bins - active_bins_centre)/4)
glimpse(activity_2mins_scaled)

## Monkey as a random effect, why? Is this sensible?
aov(active_bins_scaled ~ age_centred*day + Error(monkey), data = activity_2mins_scaled) |>
summary()
## formula
formula <- active_bins_scaled ~ age_centred*day + (1 | monkey)
## lme4
library(lme4)
fit_lme4 <- lme4::lmer(formula, activity_2mins_scaled)
fit_lme4 |>
summary()
predictmeans::predictmeans(fit_lme4, "day")
## lmerTest, is this the same model as above
library(lmerTest)
fit_lmerTest <- lmerTest::lmer(formula, activity_2mins_scaled)
fit_lmerTest |>
summary()
predictmeans::predictmeans(fit_lmerTest, "day")
## glmmTMB, is this the same model as above
library(glmmTMB)
fit_glmmtmb <- glmmTMB::glmmTMB(formula, activity_2mins_scaled)
fit_glmmtmb |> summary()
## and what does this show?
emmeans::emmeans(fit_glmmtmb, specs = "day") |>
 plot(pairwise = TRUE)
```

## The Terminology of Experimental Design {#sec-edterms}

### The Grammar of Experimental Designs^[The title stolen shamelessly from [Emi Tanaka's ebook](https://emitanaka.org/edibble-book/)] 

This section briefly summaries the terms and concepts discussed in [this section of the course guide](https://biosci738.github.io/BIOSCI738/introduction-to-the-design-and-analysis-of-experiments.html) and [Emi Tanaka's `edibble` ebook](https://emitanaka.org/edibble-book/). Refer tho these sources for more details definitions.

**Experimental design FAQs**

**Why are specific objectives important?** *Defining specific objectives direct you towards writing focused statements about the investigative questions you want your experiment to answer. The objective(s) are what it is you are aiming to accomplish in the experiment. The objective(s) should be written in terms of a specific verb that describes what you are doing (e.g., what you are hoping to measure/analyze/determine/test etc.).*

**What is the response variable?** *The response (or dependent) variable is the focus of your experiment; it is the variable that you will measure to accomplish your objective. It should be meaningful (i.e., represent the objective) and measurable.*

**What is an experimental factor?** *An experimental factor refers to a variable whose values that will be varied in the experiment with the goal of understanding how changes in the factor’s values explain difference in the responses in the measured variables.*

**Why list the experimental factors?** *Listing the experimental factors (or treatments or independent variables) you will study in your experiment helps to organise variables and work out how they may help to explain observed changes in your measurable response(s). It is important that the experimental factor can be controlled during and between experimental runs. Variables that are thought to affect the response, but cannot be controlled^[often termed nuisance variables], cannot be included as an experimental factor.*

**What is the experimental material?** *Experimental material (or units) is the material upon which something will be changed. To identify this you should answer the following questions. 1) Who or what are the subjects of your experiment? 2) How will you apply the experimental treatments to them? and 3) How will they be managed for taking measurements on them?*

**Is a 'shared environment' an issue?** *In some experiments, while the treatments are independently applied to subjects, subsets of subjects from the same treatment group share the same environment (e.g., are housed together). Since these subjects share environmental conditions, the measurements made on them cannot be considered to be independent of one another^[Random effect models to the rescue!]*
