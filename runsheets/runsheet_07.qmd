### Randomly allocated groups

**It's your responsibility to get into these, just look for the cows!**

```{r}
group_allocation(names, seed = 1631, 10)
```

[**Partitioning Variation**](https://canvas.auckland.ac.nz/courses/120054/files/15015121?module_item_id=2581434) some examples.






### Sums of Squares activity {#sec-ss}

Together, work through the code snippets from [this section of the course guide Sums of squares (SS)](https://biosci738.github.io/BIOSCI738/modelling-experimental-data.html#sums-of-squares-ss), you may have to refer to previous sections (e.g., the [One-Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) section from Module 2](https://biosci738.github.io/BIOSCI738/parametric-hypothesis-testing.html#one-way-analysis-of-variance-anova)) if you are unfamiliar with some of the terminology, and discuss/answer the following

 + What are sums of squares (SS)?
 + What role do SS play in statistics?
 + What is meant by the term sequential Sums of Squares? And what effect, if any, might this have on inference?
 + Explain the reasoning/answers above for an [r/ExplainLikeImFive](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/?rdt=41742) audience.

You may find the pseudo code below useful.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
## template only, you will have to rename variables accordingly
## run segments/lines one at a time to see the steps
data %>% 
    mutate(grand_mean = mean(response)) %>%
   mutate(sstotal = (response - grand_mean) ^2 ) %>%
    group_by(treatment) %>%
   mutate(treatment_mean = mean(response),
          sse = (response - treatment_mean)^2,
          tmp = (treatment_mean - grand_mean)^2) %>%
   summarise(ss_tot = sum(sstotal), ss_e = sum(sse), ss_treat = sum(tmp)) %>%
   pull(ss_treat) %>% sum()
```

## Bonus activity 
If you have some spare time sketch a concept map or illustration about sequential Sums of Squares.

## Multiple comparisons {#sec-multi}


:::{.callout-warning icon=false}
## <i class="fa fa-question-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> <i class="fa fa-users" aria-hidden="true"></i> <i class="fa fa-pencil-square" aria-hidden="true"></i> Head to this [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Hby1zVqv39pZSaXwBifZ7W_Mz9fmTWYP8LQ6U8BUQ54/edit?usp=sharing)...

In your groups discuss and answer the following points/questions, which relate the the snippet of code that follows.

 1. What is each line doing? 
 2. What is the relevance of 0.05  in the final line of the loop?
 3. What happens if you change this value?
 4. What happens if you change `n`, and why?
 5. What is this an example of? Why is this the case? Can you explain this reasoning for an [r/ExplainLikeImFive](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/?rdt=41742) audience?

Now, amend the code to ``test" the same thing using another statistical test of your choice.
 
```{r, eval = FALSE}
n <- 10000
t1err <- 0
for (i in 1:n){
    set.seed(1432 + i)
    x <- rnorm(100, 0, 1)
   if (((t.test(x, mu = 0))$p.value)<=0.05) (t1err = t1err + 1)
}
cat("Type I error rate in percentage is", (t1err/n)*100,"%", "\n")

```

Finally, think back to @sec-significance. What are your thoughts on *significance*, have they changed?
