So I use AI to help me go through a quick run through around how they work. I also feel like it’s super useful for debugging, but also at the same time takes a way a really important skill to learn how to debug. Understanding and finding mistakes, so that these do not occur again is incredibly important. I do think it’s important to make use of it, cause it’s likely gonna be used in future jobs to some extent. So it’s important to understand where and when we can use it to make some tasks more efficient while when not to use it. ",

I don't worry about my peers using these tools because I believe that I will have the ability to think independently when I enter the graduate stage.

* I am not sure about the future development of GenAI, but I think I will follow the requirements of the course and teachers, and use appropriate tools to help me learn within the scope of compliance.

* GenAI can only use by suitable places, GenAI can be used to provide ideas, or provide a writing outline. If we are completing a paper or just an essay, it is best not to let GenAI do the whole thing, the article needs to have our own thinking.

* It does help. I don't think I've fully utilized GenAI, and I'm still looking for more appropriate ways to train AI.

First of all, we have to admit that AI tools are taking an increasingly huge part of our life as they are developing incredibly, in some fields, especially in the design and coding field, my colleagues and friends said the AI tools did help them a lot with their jobs. Yet as the regulations and laws about AI are still at the early phase, using AI ethically is mostly depends on the individual's moral standard, thus I believe using AI requires a specific rule or at least there should be a line to declare the AI can be used in which situation or level.

For myself, I haven't used AI that much, and I only used it to prepare for my interviews, like searching for information of some specific things.",
"A Few,A Few,Disagree,Disagree,Allowed in some assignments\, disallowed in others (based on the assignment type\, course level\, etc.),Strongly Agree,Disagree,Neutral,Disagree,Agree,Disagree,Agree,Agree","I used to use AI to generate paintings.

Overall, the results were pretty much what I wanted, but there were always some parts that weren't as good as I could have been, even though I described the prompts in a clear and detailed way. This requires me to make my own changes based on the results it generates.

So my point is that generative AI can save time and increase efficiency for practitioners. But if you need AI-generated content that is beyond your ability level, and you can't verify and modify the results, the results will often be unsatisfactory.

While I look forward to the day when generative AI will be able to produce exactly what I expected and don't need to be modified, I still feel anxious and worried about it if I can't verify it.",

AI is a great tool to dump all your curiosities and deep opinions onto regarding a topic, use it to understand a subject in greater depth, but having it do all the work for you feels dangerous and most importantly ungratifying. 

 

In my opinion, the controversy behind LLMs and other AIs is rather blown out of proportion, if people use it to do all their assignments for them it should be EASILY detectable for any marker/instructor, there should be no difference between using an AI generator and having a semi-reliable online tutor, that can help you steer your work in the right direction and help you understand concepts that otherwise would be too difficult to grasp by one's self. ",

Ethically? Yikes—hidden biases in training data and copyright gray zones worry me, not to mention companies quietly replacing roles with bots. As for peers, some treat ChatGPT like a homework vending machine (copy-paste essays = bad news), and over-reliance on AI coding tools risks turning us into debug-illiterates. Learning-wise, it’s turbocharged research (Perplexity’s my go-to), but I’ve caught myself skimming surfaces instead of diving deep. Personally, I’ve hacked deadlines with Midjourney for posters and Claude for digesting dense reports, though I always fact-check—AI’s the shortcut, but my brain’s still the GPS!",

It would great if it meant that manpower could be concentrated or reorganised into areas where we need human thinking the most, but only time will tell!

I do think that GenAI should be thoroughly discussed and incorporated into learning environments since it appears that it will be sticking around for the long run. That way, more people will be made aware of its potential uses/misuses, ethical complications (e.g malicious intent?!, or even art generating models trained using art without permissions) and how we should handle GenAI in the future.

I have found it very useful as a learning tool especially when summarising large quantities of notes or as a study tool (creating potential essay questions etc).

I have also found it very useful for debugging code/suggesting better ways of writing the code, allowing me to continue to learn without constantly having to go to someone more knowledgeable.

Regarding other Gen AI like Chat GPT or Copliot, I haven't used it much for my academic purpose; I mostly use it for personal purposes.

Reg academically, I use it to understand some topics that were new to me and reg coding, I have used it to understand existing codes and to search syntax for specific algorithms but not for generating a large chunk of code. I do not see any point in using a code that I myself won't understand.

(Of course, all these were done during my work, not during my academic years; I haven't done much of coding from an academic perspective), There was one course where I had to do a bit of coding, but in that course, the use of AI was permitted as long as we understood the codes and provided comments on our reasoning for using that particular code. I feel that, in those scenarios, AI was used like a colleague who would help us out when we were stuck somewhere.

But I would not accept if someone uses the large chunk of code from AI without understanding (mostly, it's not going to be helpful for them), and most of the time, the code that it generates will not be the solution for our problem. ",

Anyone can use this tool, but in order to really benefit from it, you need to have a foundation in the knowledge you are asking for. For example, I will not fully grasp and ""learn"" how to code with zero prior experience if I ask ChatGPT to explain to me how to create a specific script that can read and write files. I will not be able to then apply this knowledge in other aspects of coding or even pass the information along. However, I believe if you are a student who has a good foundation in coding, you may find generative AI beneficial for those niche questions you can rapidly answer that will refresh you, for example you forgot where to find a specific prompt.

"Some,Some,Disagree,Neutral,Allowed in some assignments\, disallowed in others (based on the assignment type\, course level\, etc.),Agree,Disagree,Disagree,Disagree,Agree,Disagree,Neutral,Neutral",I think Gen AI can be a really useful and powerful tool but in academic/coursework settings there can be a lot of grey area so I tend to avoid it for research and writing. In general I don't think it is sustainably ethical and I don't enjoy the increasing prevalence and reliance on AI in academic settings and in day to day life due the large environmental impacts and blurry ethics. That being said when it comes to coding it can be a very useful tool from my personal experience. However I'm not very well versed in the ethics of coding hence why I answered neutral to the previous questions about whether copying code verbatim is ethical. I'm excited to learn more in this course and discuss AI further because I find it very fascinating!,
